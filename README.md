# PyD

PyD provides seamless interoperability between Python and the D programming language.

This repo is a fork with the aim of massively cleaning up PyD and bringing it up to
speed with modern D.

So far it's mostly been a job of deleting old things and revamping the build system.

Currently only D extensions to python are supported

# Requirements

## Python

CPython 2.7+

## D Compilers

Currently tested and working on DMD 2.068+, others may work too, don't know.
